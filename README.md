# ineuron-Internship-mushroom-classification-
  This is the name of the project and also indicates that it is a project being done as part of an internship.
# Objective üéØ
  The objective of this internship project is to develop a machine learning system that can accurately classify mushrooms as **poisonous** or **edible** based on their characteristics.
# Problem Statement
  The dataset used for this project is the Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms, which contains descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom (1981). The main goal of the project is to predict which mushroom is poisonous and which is edible, which is of great importance as many mushroom species are highly toxic and can cause serious illness or even death if ingested.

# Domain üìö
  **Agriculture.**

This project has important implications for the agricultural industry as it can help farmers and other professionals involved in the cultivation and harvesting of mushrooms to identify poisonous varieties and prevent their distribution to the market. 
This can help prevent potential health hazards to consumers and maintain the integrity of the industry.
# Project difficulty level ü•â

# Tools and Software used üõ†Ô∏è
  The following **tools** and **software** were used in this **project**:

**Python 3**: A programming language used for developing the machine learning system and the command-line interface.

**Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive development environment used for data exploration, data cleaning, and model building.

**Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for Python that provides implementations of various classical machine learning algorithms.

**Pandas**: A Python library for data manipulation and analysis.

**NumPy**: A Python library for numerical computing.

**Matplotlib**: A Python library for data visualization.
# Conclusion üí°
  In conclusion, the Mushroom Classification Internship Project has successfully developed a machine learning system that can accurately classify mushrooms as poisonous or edible based on their characteristics. The project employed classical machine learning techniques like data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and model testing to achieve this goal. The system was developed using Python 3 and several libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The end result was a command-line interface that allows users to input the characteristics of a mushroom and receive a prediction of its edibility.

This project has important implications for public health as it can help people avoid consuming poisonous mushrooms and potentially prevent serious illness or even death. 

The project also demonstrates the power of machine learning and its potential applications in various fields.

Overall, this internship project provided a valuable learning experience in developing machine learning systems and working with real-world datasets.
 I hope that the project will be useful to anyone interested in machine learning, data science, or mushroom classification.
